## Installation
This project is currently in development and may not be easy to install on your system.
Please see [issues](https://github.com/vocalpy/sappy/issues).

The eventual goal is to be able to install across platform, like so:  
`pip install SAP-Python`
Note this name is used because there is already a [`sappy` on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/sappy/) 
that appears to be maintained.

## Usage

### Project history
Originally developed by [Paul Ecoffet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulecoffet/) 
as [`birdsonganalysis`](https://github.com/PaulEcoffet/birdsonganalysis), 
a port to Python of [Sound Analysis Tools for Matlab](http://soundanalysispro.com/matlab-sat).
This version being developed by [David Nicholson](https://github.com/NickleDave/),
with help from [Therese Koch](https://github.com/theresekoch) who got the whole thing started at SciPy 2022, 
and who insists that people should be able to use things on Windows.
